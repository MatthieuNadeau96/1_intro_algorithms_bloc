1.) An algorithm that has O(1) is a jet and an algorithm that has O(2^n) is a car.

2.) The best case scenario for binary search is if the middle point of the collection is the value being searched for. If using a tree to represent binary search, the mid point would be the top of the tree.

3.) The worst case scenario for binary search is if the value being searched for is at the first or very last index of the collection. Using a tree, it would be at the very bottom of the tree.

4.) Using a tree to represent the binary search, the bounded case scenario would be if the value being searched for is somewhere between the top and bottom of the tree.

5.) Google Sheet

6.) Does not exist.

7.) O(2^n)

8.) linear_search.rb

9.) I'm having trouble understanding what questions 8 and 9 are asking.

10.) O(1)

11.) Ω(1)

12.) Ө(log n)
