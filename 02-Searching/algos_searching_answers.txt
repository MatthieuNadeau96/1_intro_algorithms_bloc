                                                QUESTIONS(1):

1.) Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

2.) Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

3.) Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.

                                                ANSWERS(1):

1.) Given the alphabetically sorted collection in the checkpoint, it would take 7 iterations to find G using linear search.

2.) It would take 3 iterations using binary search to find G.

3.) fib(10) = 55, fib(11) = 89, fib(12) = 144

    n = 10 | fib(10-2) =  8 + 13 = 21 | fib(10-1) = 13 + 21 = 34 | fib(n) = 34 + 21 = 55
    n = 11 | fib(11-2) = 13 + 21 = 34 | fib(11-1) = 21 + 34 = 55 | fib(n) = 55 + 34 = 89
    n = 12 | fib(12-2) = 21 + 34 = 55 | fib(12-1) = 34 + 55 = 89 | fib(n) = 55 + 89 = 144

                                                QUESTIONS(2):

1.) Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.

2.) Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.

                                                ANSWERS(2):

1.) For an unsorted collection I would use linear, simply because binary only works with sorted collections.

2.) Now, if the collection is sorted I would certainly use binary, for it is much faster. I would use an iterative solution because I find it easier to implement, and I also faster with binary search.
